# Standardizing-the-Classification-of-Programming-Language-Components
# Abstract

This paper proposes a systematic framework for classifying programming language components into five essential sections: Data, Processes, Input/Output (I/O), Structural, and Dependence. Each section encompasses distinct categories of reserved words and standard library functions, facilitating a clearer understanding and design of programming languages. This standardized classification aims to enhance language design, interoperability, and educational methodologies, filling a gap in the existing literature.
